                    <p><em>by Peter Thiel and Sean Parker</em></p>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. 
                        Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, 
                        waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic.
                        The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, 
                        rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.
                        In 2015, Google trained a conversational agent (AI) that could not only convincingly interact with humans as a tech support helpdesk, 
                        but also discuss morality, express opinions, and answer general facts-based questions.

                                <figcaption>We have zero visibility into what happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole because no light can escape. 
                                    Similarly, after we unlock AI’s ability to recursively improve itself, it’s impossible to predict what will happen.

                        <p>Artificial intelligence is the study of agents that perceive the world around them, form plans, 
                        and make decisions to achieve their goals. Its foundations include mathematics, logic, philosophy, 
                        probability, linguistics, neuroscience, and decision theory. Many fields fall under the umbrella of AI, 
                        such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing.
                        Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to enable computers to learn on their own. 
                        A machine’s learning algorithm enables it to identify patterns in observed data, build models that explain the world, 
                        and predict things without having explicit pre-programmed rules and models.

                <em>As a design thinker, I’m interested in clean aesthetics, minimalism, typography and simplistic solutions.
                As a developer, I try to write code that is easy to understand, easy to change and fun to work with. 
                I strive for clean, elegant and efficient code to assure long-term sustainability and keep software's maintainability.
                I want to make things that make a difference. I work to the principle of keeping it simple, while carefully including the finest details and interactions.
